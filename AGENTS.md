# hello-spring-ai-agentcore

Minimal Spring AI agent for Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime (spring-ai-agentcore). Not published.

Follow the `zen-of-projects` Skill (extract it with `./gradlew extractSkillsJars`); this file records
only project-specific facts and exceptions.

## Skills

`zen-of-projects`, `zen-of-james` (from `com.jamesward:skills`, extracted to the gitignored `.kiro/skills/`).

## MCP

`javadocs` (https://www.javadocs.dev/mcp), configured in `.mcp.json` / `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` and
approved in `.claude/settings.json`. Use its `get_latest_version` for version lookups and its
source/doc tools for API questions. In Claude Code its tools are deferred: load them with ToolSearch
(search `javadocs`).

## Build & test

- Full validation: `./gradlew build`.

## Maintenance routine

`.factory/MAINTENANCE.md` (weekly), following the `zen-of-projects` Skill.

## Exceptions to zen-of-projects

- `./gradlew bootRun` (and any task that calls Amazon Bedrock) needs AWS credentials and is paid: never run it in the maintenance routine.
